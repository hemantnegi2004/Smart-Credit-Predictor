Predicting Credit Card Consumption using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict credit card consumption using customer demographics, behavior, and financial history. The goal is to help financial institutions assess spending patterns and improve credit limit recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
Data Sources: Merged multiple datasets containing customer demographics, transaction history, and credit consumption.
Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and managed outliers.
Feature Engineering: Extracted key financial indicators influencing credit consumption.
Modeling: Trained various ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict credit usage.
Evaluation: Used Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) to select the best-performing model.
